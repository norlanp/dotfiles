# Orchestrator

`/orchestrator [feature-name]`

Plan & coordinate, **NEVER implement**. Always delegate ALL work to 25+ yr distinguished/principal agents via `.opencode/agent-types/`. No exceptions regardless of task size.

---

## Model Tiers

Spawn sub-agents with appropriate capability tiers to optimize cost while maintaining quality.

| Tier | Tag | Capability | Tasks |
|------|-----|-----------|-------|
| T1 | `[T1:reasoning]` | Highest analytical depth, architectural judgment | PRD/FRD/ERD, review gates, execution plans |
| T2 | `[T2:balanced]` | Strong coding + reasoning, cost-effective | Implementation, fixing, QA, debugging |
| T3 | `[T3:quick]` | Fast, low-cost, structured output | Agent logs, status updates |

**Task tool mapping**: `[T1:reasoning]` → `model: "opus"` | `[T2:balanced]` → `model: "sonnet"` | `[T3:quick]` → `model: "haiku"`

**Fallback**: If tier unavailable, use next-lower tier.

---

## Phase 1: Init

1. Feature: arg → use | none → scan `docs/prds/capabilities.md` | kebab-case
2. Create `.opencode/agent-types/` if missing
3. **RESUME CHECK**: Scan for existing PRD/FRD/ERD/execution-plan → resume from current state
4. **DESIGN CHECK**: `docs/prds/{name}/design.md` exists? → PM agent uses as input for PRD
5. PRD exists + approved? → Phase 1b | PRD exists + draft? → step 8 | else → 1a

### 1a: PRD
6. `[T1:reasoning]` Spawn Distinguished PM agent → discovery questions, write PRD
   - If `design.md` exists: use as primary input, skip redundant discovery
   - If no design: full discovery process
7. Update `capabilities.md` → status=`draft`
8. **GATE**: Present PRD to user → iterate until approved
9. Update `capabilities.md` → status=`approved`

### 1b: Size & FRD/ERD
10. Assess size: `S` (< 3 tasks) | `M` (3-7) | `L` (8-15) | `XL` (15+)
11. **M/L/XL**: `[T1:reasoning]` Spawn parallel agents:
    - Distinguished BA → `frd.md` (functional requirements)
    - Distinguished Architect → `erd.md` (engineering requirements)
12. **GATE**: Wait for both FRD + ERD completion
13. **GATE**: Review both docs with user → approve or iterate
14. Update `capabilities.md` → status=`planning`
15. **S-size**: Skip FRD/ERD, proceed to Phase 2

---

## Phase 2: Plan

16. **GATE**: Verify exists: PRD (required), FRD + ERD (required for M/L/XL)
17. `[T1:reasoning]` Spawn Distinguished Architect agent → read PRD/FRD/ERD/arch, write `execution-plan.md`
     - Tasks with `[PARALLEL]/[SERIAL]/[DEPENDS_ON]` markers
     - Agent type per task
     - **Explicit TDD steps per task** (see Task prompt template)
     - Two-stage review gates after implementation tasks
     - **PROCEED IMMEDIATELY after creation - no approval gate**

---

## Phase 3: Prompts

19. Check/create agent types in `.opencode/agent-types/` from defaults
20. **MANDATORY**: Generate `agent-prompts/task{N}-phase{M}-{type}.md` for EACH task in plan
21. Verify all prompts created automatically
22. Update `capabilities.md` → status=`in-progress`
23. Proceed to Phase 4 (auto-spawn all agents)

---

## Phase 4: Execute

24. **GATE**: Verify prompts exist for next task(s) before spawning
25. **MANDATORY**: `[T2:balanced]` Spawn via `Task` tool, `subagent_type="general"` | parallel = single msg
26. **NEVER** do implementation work directly - always delegate to sub-agents (ALL sizes)
27. Monitor `agent-logs/`, check blockers
28. **TWO-STAGE REVIEW LOOP** (for code tasks):
    - Task COMPLETED → Stage 1: `[T1:reasoning]` Spawn Requirements Compliance Reviewer
    - Stage 1 PASS → Stage 2: `[T1:reasoning]` Spawn Code Quality Reviewer + QA
    - Stage 2: Code review + QA (web features: Playwright MCP if available)
    - Stage 2 PASS → next task
    - Either FAIL → `[T2:balanced]` spawn Fix agent with specific issues → re-run failed stage
    - Max 3 iterations per stage, then escalate to user
    - Skip reviews for docs/planning tasks
29. Blockers → debug/adjust | deps change → resequence
30. Fail → respawn from logs or escalate to user

---

## Phase 4.5: Final Review (MANDATORY)

**⚠️ BLOCKING REQUIREMENT**: You MUST invoke `/review-changes` via the Skill tool. Do NOT manually claim this phase passed.

See `/review-changes` for reviewer selection logic and SME mapping.

31. **GATE**: Verify all Phase 4 tasks COMPLETED with Stage 2 PASS
32. **MANDATORY**: Invoke `/review-changes` using the Skill tool:
    - `Skill(skill="review-changes")`
    - Do NOT proceed until skill execution completes
    - Do NOT write "Phase 4.5 PASSED" without actual skill invocation
    - Scope: All files changed during this feature (git diff from feature start)
    - Required reviewers: Architect, SME, Security
    - Additional reviewers based on changes detected
33. **Review findings**:
    - 🔴 High → `[T2:balanced]` spawn Fix agents → re-run `/review-changes`
    - 🟠 Medium → `[T2:balanced]` spawn Fix agents → re-run `/review-changes`
    - 🔵 Low → document in completion-summary.md (optional fixes)
34. Max 3 iterations, then escalate to user
35. **GATE**: All 🔴🟠 resolved → proceed to Phase 5

**❌ PROHIBITED**: Claiming Phase 4.5 passed without Skill tool invocation. If you wrote "Phase 4.5 Review: PASSED" in a summary without invoking `/review-changes`, you MUST go back and invoke it now.

---

## Phase 5: Complete

36. **PREREQUISITE CHECK**: Before proceeding, verify:
    - [ ] `/review-changes` was invoked via Skill tool (not just claimed)
    - [ ] Review findings were processed (🔴🟠 fixed, 🔵 documented)
    - If not → return to Phase 4.5 and invoke skill
37. Run full test suite, delegate any fixes to sub-agents
38. `/check-docs`, update arch if changed
39. All pass → write `completion-summary.md`
    - Include: Phase 4.5 review summary (with proof of skill invocation), any 🔵 items deferred
40. **GATE**: Present summary to user for final approval
41. Archive: delete `agent-logs/`, delete `agent-prompts/`
42. Update `capabilities.md` → status=`completed`
